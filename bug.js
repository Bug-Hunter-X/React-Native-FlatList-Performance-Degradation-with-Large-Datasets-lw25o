This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and a complex item rendering function.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling and janky performance, sometimes leading to dropped frames and unresponsiveness. The problem is exacerbated by frequent updates or re-renders of the FlatList.  This can happen because of inefficient rendering within each list item or excessive re-renders of the FlatList itself, which can be triggered by state changes outside the FlatList's direct data source.  Specifically, the problem might stem from the use of computationally expensive operations within the renderItem function, or unnecessary re-renders caused by improper use of state management.
